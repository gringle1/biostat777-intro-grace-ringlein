WEIGHT_W65). When using multiple waves of data, it is important to consider which weights will be most appropriate for the sample. In this example analysis, we use Wave 65 weights, as a larger percentage of Wave 65 participants are included in our sample than the percentage of Wave 54 participants.

    "text": "Conclusions\nDescriptive plots using survey-weighted means and 95% confidence intervals suggest that financial worries (measured by a composite score made up of four sub-scores) decreased overall between September 2019 and April 2020 (see Figure 2). While this trend is also seen among those who did not report that they experienced income or job loss by April 2020, financial worry score remained more constant among those who did report income or job loss by April 2020 (see Figure 3). When investigating the subscores of financial worries separately (see Figure 4), we see that worry about bills for those who experienced income or job loss increased between September 2019 and April 2020, but decreased for all other types of worries, in both subgroups. This suggests that there may be nuanced of trends by worry type and job loss status and highlight the need for careful data exploration prior to a formal analysis. Future analyses should consider potential confounders and methods such as propensity score weighting to address pre-existing differences between those who experienced income or job loss and those who did not.\n\nData wrangling functions used:\n\nselect\ngroup_by\nsummarize\nmutate\nfilter\npivot_longer\nrename_at\n\n\n\nPlotting functions used:\n\ngeom_bar\ngeom_point\ngeom_errorbar\ngeom_line\nfacet_wrap\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.
