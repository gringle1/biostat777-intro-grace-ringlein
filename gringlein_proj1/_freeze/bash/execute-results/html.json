The top level directory should be called raw_data and there should be a sub-level directory called fastq. The command you write should force the creation of both directories at the same time if either of them do not exist yet.\nMove all the .fastq files into the fastq sub-level directory.\nList all the .fastq files that end in a 12 or 13.\nSearch for the string NNNN in the SRR1039512_subset_1.fastq file. In addition to returning the matched line in the .fastq file, your output should also return the two lines before and the four lines after the matching line.\nWrite a for loop in the shell that iterates over each .fastq file. For each .fastq file, do the following. In the first 1000 rows for each file, count the number of lines where the “@” symbol appears. Your final output should be four numbers printed to the screen.\n\nUse wget to download four files that end in .fastq from here.\n\n```{bash}\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2023/main/data/SRR1039508_subset_1.fastq\n \nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2023/main/data/SRR1039512_subset_1.fastq\n  \nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2023/main/data/SRR1039509_subset_1.fastq\n   \nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stephaniehicks/jhustatprogramming2023/main/data/SRR1039513_subset_1.fastq\n```\n\nCreate a directory to download the data.
