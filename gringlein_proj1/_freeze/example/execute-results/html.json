How did frequency of financial worry changed between 2019 and the start of the pandemic?\n\n2.  Were there differences in how financial worry changed between those who did and did not report household job or income loss at the start of the pandemic?\n\n2.  Were there differences in how financial worry changed between those who did and did not report household job or income loss at the start of the pandemic, for specfic types of financial worry (worry about debt, bills, health care, and retirement)?\n\n### Audience\n\nThe intended analysis is a researcher interested in using multiple waves of Pew Research Center American Trends Panel data. \n\n## Motivation for the example\n\nRecord levels of unemployment were reached at the start of the pandemic and were experienced unequally across socioeconomic groups[@bartik_measuring_2020]. Most analyses of the COVID-19 recession focus on objective measures of financial status, but perceived financial strain may be an important component of economic hardship, as it can be a predictor of mental health status above and beyond objective financial status[@wilkinson_financial_2016]. Thus, I investigate changes in worry about bills before and after the pandemic.\n\n![Figure 1. Unemployment during the pandemic by income group](chart.png)\n\n## Data download\n\nThe ATP data is publicly available one year after data collection and can be downloaded here: https://www.pewresearch.org/american-trends-panel-datasets/\n\nFor this analysis, we will use Wave 54[@noauthor_pew_2019] and Wave 65[@noauthor_pew_2020].\n\n::: callout-note\n## Downloaded zip vile\n\nThe download for each wave will contain a \".sav\" file with data and additional pdf files containing information about the data including descriptions of variables in the data.\n:::\n\n## Setup Analysis\n\nAnalysis is conducted in R. We will use the following packages:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(foreign)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(knitr)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(diagis) \n```\n:::\n\n\nThe downloaded data files are placed into a folder called \"data\" in the working directory. The foreign package allows us to read in the data in a labelled format.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nW54 <- foreign::read.spss(here(\"data\",\"ATP W54.sav\"), to.data.frame = TRUE)\nW65 <- foreign::read.spss(here(\"data\",\"ATP W65.sav\"), to.data.frame = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe prepare to merge the two waves of data by renaming the columns that do not have wave number suffixes, and merge the two waves (using participant id \"QKEY\") to only include those who responded to both waves.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nW54 <- W54 %>% rename_at(vars(!matches(\"*(_W54)\"),-QKEY),\n                         ~paste0(., '_W54'))\nW65 <- W65 %>% rename_at(vars(!matches(\"*(_W65)\"),-QKEY),\n                         ~paste0(., '_W65'))\n\nall <- W54 %>% \n  inner_join(W65,by=\"QKEY\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThere are 6878 participants who completed Wave 54, 4917 who completed wave 65, and 2747 who completed both waves participants\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(W54)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 6878\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(W65)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 4917\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nnrow(all)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 2747\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, we create a composite column for whether a participant experienced household or self job loss (COVIDWORK_a_W65) or income loss (COVIDWORK_b_W65) due to the pandemic, by April 2020.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall <- all %>% mutate(\n  \"COVIDWORK_comp_W65\" = case_when(\n    is.na(COVIDWORK_a_W65) & is.na(COVIDWORK_b_W65) ~ \"Refused/Missing\",\n    COVIDWORK_a_W65 == \"Yes, has happened\" | COVIDWORK_b_W65 == \"Yes, has happened\" ~ \"Yes, has happened\",\n    TRUE ~ \"No, has not happened\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nn=1081 experienced income or job loss and n=1666 did not.\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n    COVIDWORK_comp_W65    n\n1 No, has not happened 1666\n2    Yes, has happened 1081\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe select only the columns of interest for this analysis and rename the Wave 65 financial strain columns to have the same naming schema as Wave 54.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall <- all %>% select(QKEY,WEIGHT_W65, \n                      income_loss=COVIDWORK_comp_W65,\n                      contains(\"WORRY\")) %>% \n  relocate(\"QKEY\",contains(\"RESPONDED\")) \n\nall <- all %>% rename_at(vars(matches(\"(WORRY)(.*)(W65)\")),\n                         ~str_remove(.,\"_\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, we convert the data into a long format, (where each participant has a separate row for each combination of wave and question). We also convert the worry questions from frequency categories to integers for this exploration, such that a score of 0 for a particular category corresponds to worrying \"Never\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong <- all %>% pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"WORRY\"),\n  names_to = c(\".value\",\"Wave\"),\n  names_pattern = \"(.*_)(W\\\\d+)\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"WORRY\"),\n  names_to = c(\".value\",\"Q\"),\n  names_pattern = \"(.*2)(.)\") %>% \n  mutate(\"WORRY_int\" = case_when(\n    WORRY2 == \"Never\" ~ 0,\n    WORRY2 == \"Rarely\" ~ 1,\n    WORRY2 == \"Sometimes\" ~ 2,\n    WORRY2 == \"Almost every day\" ~ 3,\n    WORRY2 == \"Every day\" ~ 4,\n    TRUE ~ NA))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Missing data\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-margin}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong %>% \n  group_by(Q,Wave) %>% \n  summarize(\"n_miss\"=sum(is.na(WORRY_int)),\n            \"perc_missing\"=n_miss/n()) %>%\n  knitr::kable()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n|Q  |Wave | n_miss| perc_missing|\n|:--|:----|------:|------------:|\n|a  |W54  |     18|    0.0065526|\n|a  |W65  |      6|    0.0021842|\n|b  |W54  |   1038|    0.3778668|\n|b  |W65  |   1235|    0.4495814|\n|c  |W54  |     11|    0.0040044|\n|c  |W65  |      7|    0.0025482|\n|d  |W54  |     18|    0.0065526|\n|d  |W65  |      9|    0.0032763|\n|e  |W54  |     48|    0.0174736|\n|e  |W65  |     28|    0.0101929|\n|f  |W54  |   2747|    1.0000000|\n|f  |W65  |   1233|    0.4488533|\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe investigate the missing data patterns for our variables of interest and note that questions b and f have high levels of missingness. Looking at the questionnaire, we can see that b, worry about losing ones job, was only asked to those who were employed. Additionally, 2f (worry about paycuts) was only asked in April 2020 and only to those who were employed, and was not asked in Sept 2019. Therefore, for our initial investigation, we focus on questions a, c, d, e, respectively corresponding to worry about debt, bills, cost of health care, and being able to save enough for retirement, and exclude those with missing data (n=90). \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong <- long %>% filter(!(Q %in% c(\"b\",\"f\")))  %>% \n  mutate(Q = case_when(\n    Q == \"a\" ~ \"Debt\",\n    Q == \"c\" ~ \"Bills\",\n    Q == \"d\" ~ \"Healthcare\",\n    Q == \"e\" ~\"Retirement\"))\n\nany_na <- long %>% \n  group_by(QKEY) %>% \n  summarize(any_na = sum(is.na(WORRY_int))) %>% \n  filter(any_na > 0) %>% pull(QKEY)\n\nlength(any_na)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 90\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong <- long %>% filter(!(QKEY %in% any_na))\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Descriptive analysis\n\nWe will visualize the change in financial worry between September 2019 and April 2020 both in a composite worry score (adding up the sub-scores for debt, bills, health care, and retirement) and for the separate sub-scores, in total and by income or job loss group.\n\n::: callout-caution\nEach wave of ATP data has a column in the downloaded data with associated survey weights (ex. WEIGHT_W65). When using multiple waves of data, it is important to consider which weights will be most appropriate for the sample. In this example analysis, we use Wave 65 weights, as a larger percentage of Wave 65 participants are included in our sample than the percentage of Wave 54 participants. However, in-order to obtain nationally representative estimates, it still may be necessary to create custom weights for the sample used in the analysis.\n:::\n\n### Financial worry between September 2019 and April 2020\n\nFirst we plot both the un-weighted and the survey weighted mean and standard error of the mean composite worry score, for each wave, along with confidence intervals. We can see that without using survey weights, we would conclude that there are not significant differences in the mean worry score before and after the start of the pandemic, but using survey weighting, there is a significantly difference in worry before and after the start of the pandemic. This highlights the importance of using survey weights. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong %>% group_by(Wave,QKEY) %>%\n  summarize(worry_sum = sum(WORRY_int)) %>% \n  left_join(select(all,QKEY,WEIGHT_W65),by=\"QKEY\") %>% \n  group_by(Wave) %>% \n  summarize(mean_unweighted=mean(worry_sum),\n            mean_weighted = weighted.mean(worry_sum,WEIGHT_W65),\n            se_unweighted=sd(worry_sum)/sqrt(n()),\n            se_weighted=weighted_se(worry_sum,WEIGHT_W65)) %>%\n  ungroup() %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"mean\"),\n  names_to = c(\".value\",\"Weighting_mean\"),\n  names_pattern = \"(.*_)(.*weighted)\") %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with(\"se\"),\n  names_to = c(\".value\",\"Weighting_se\"),\n  names_pattern = \"(.*_)(.*weighted)\") %>% \n  filter(Weighting_mean!=Weighting_se) %>%\n  rename(mean=mean_,se=se_) %>% \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(aes(colour=Wave, y=mean,x=Weighting_mean)) + \n  geom_errorbar(aes(colour=Wave,ymin=(mean-1.96*se),ymax=(mean + 1.96*se),\n                    x=Weighting_mean),width=.05) +\n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"Financial worry\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](example_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n  labs(title=\"Figure 2.

While this trend is also seen among those who did not report that they experienced income or job loss by April 2020, financial worry score remained more constant among those who did report income or job loss by April 2020 (see **Figure 3**). When investigating the subscores of financial worries separately (see **Figure 4**), we see that worry about bills for those who experienced income or job loss increased between September 2019 and April 2020, but decreased for all other types of worries, in both subgroups. This suggests that there may be nuanced of trends by worry type and job loss status and highlight the need for careful data exploration prior to a formal analysis. Future analyses should consider potential confounders and methods such as propensity score weighting to address pre-existing differences between those who experienced income or job loss and those who did not. \n\n### Data wrangling functions used:\n\n-   select\n\n-   group_by\n\n-   summarize\n\n-   mutate\n\n-   filter\n\n-   pivot_longer\n\n-   rename_at\n\n### Plotting functions used:\n\n-   geom_bar\n\n-   geom_point\n\n-   geom_errorbar\n\n-   geom_line\n\n-   facet_wrap\n\n### References\n\n::: {#refs}\n:::\n",
